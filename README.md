# GORK

I generated the name from Zork that is a first text-based adventure game.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m gork.main
```

The base calculation code is from
[pixelator](https://github.com/connor-makowski/pixelator) project. Also
[img_term](https://github.com/JonnoFTW/img_term) app helped me to display the
image in the terminal.

# TODO

- Add a new feature to print the 8bit image in the terminal.
- Print the color palette in the terminal.
- Print metadata of images.
- Use mypy for the static typing.
- Use async for the performance improvements.
- Configure GitHub actions for the tests.
- Generate a self-contained executable file with PyOxidizer.
- Generate random palettes, to find the best colors.
- Recognize the object and texts in the images.
